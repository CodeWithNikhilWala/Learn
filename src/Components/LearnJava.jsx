                <h5>What is Java?</h5>
         <Typography>Java is a class-based object-oriented programming language for building web and desktop applications. It is the most popular programming language and the language of choice for Android programming.</Typography>
         <h5>What is Java Platform?</h5>
         <Typography>Java Platform is a collection of programs that help programmers to develop and run Java programming applications efficiently. It includes an execution engine, a compiler, and a set of libraries in it. It is a set of computer software and specifications. James Gosling developed the Java platform at Sun Microsystems, and the Oracle Corporation later acquired it.</Typography>

            Originally, it was developed for handling portable devices and set-top boxes. Oak was a massive failure.

            <h4>Components Of Java Programming Language</h4>
            </Card.Header>
            <Card.Body>
            A Java Programmer writes a program in a human-readable language called Source Code. Therefore, the CPU or Chips never understand the source code written in any programming language.
           These computers or chips understand only one thing, which is called machine language or code. These machine codes run at the CPU level. Therefore, it would be different machine codes for other models of CPU.
           However, you need to worry about the machine code, as programming is all about the source code. The machine understands this source code and translates them into machine understandable code, which is an executable code.
            All these functionalities happen inside the following 3 Java platform components:

            <h4>What are Assembler and Compiler?</h4>
            </Card.Header>
            <Card.Body>
            With the advancement in technology, i/o devices were invented. You could directly type your program into the PC using ASSEMBLER. It converts it into the corresponding machine code (110001..) and feeds it to your processor. Coming back to our example addition of (1+2), the assembler will convert this code into machine code and output.
            What are Assembler and Compiler
            That apart, you will also have to make calls to create Operating System provided functions to display the codeâ€™s output.
            But alone the assembler is not involved in this process; it also requires the compiler to compile the long code into a small chunk of codes. With the advancement in software development languages, this entire assembly code could shrink into just one line print f 1+2 A with the software called COMPILER. It is used to convert your c language code into assembly code. The assembler converts it into corresponding machine code. This machine code will be transmitted to the processor. The most common processor used in PC or Computers are the Intel processor.
              What are Assembler and Compiler
             Though present-day compilers come bundled with assembler can directly convert your higher language code into machine code.
